# WebFreeze

Concept: tool to help designers. app that allows them to:

1. load webpage
2. press "freeze"
3. move elements about
4. possibly export to SVG.

This repo provides a first go at this. Features:

1. It's based on [electron](http://electron.atom.io/).
2. Has basic freeze algorithm working.

The DOM/CSS is quite sophisticated making this quite a difficult problem to solve well.

I'm probably not going to take this any further.
